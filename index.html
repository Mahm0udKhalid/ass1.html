		 Embedded systems software can be defined as specialized programming tools in embedded devices that facilitate the functioning of the machines. The software manages various hardware devices and systems.
		      The basic idea behind embedded systems software is to control the functioning of a set of hardware devices without compromising on the purpose or the efficiency.<br><br>
		 Embedded systems software can be compared to the operating systems in computers. Much like how the operating systems control the software applications in computers, embedded systems software control various devices and ensure their smooth functioning.
		      Ideally, these software donâ€™t require user input and can function independently on preset parameters.<br><br>
		 Devices ranging from something as simple as a microwave to the more complex ones like detonators can all be controlled by embedded systems software. The software can be adjusted and calibrated per need and the device can also be connected with remotely or with other devices.
        	  <mark>It is for this reason that embedded systems hacking is a risk</mark>.<br><br>
		 The complexity of embedded systems software vary according to the devices they are controlling and also on the basis of the usage and end goal. Compared to firmware, which acts as a liaison with operating systems, 
		      embedded software are more self-reliant and directly coded.<br><br>
